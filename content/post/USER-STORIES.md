# User Stories for SecureCodeMark

This is a backlog of user stories for SecureCodeMark, a tool designed to watermark, encrypt, and track the distribution of proprietary source code to prevent unauthorized sharing. These user stories provide a structured roadmap for development and do not coincide with actual implemented features unless specified under Current Features.

# Current Features

These features are currently implemented in SecureCodeMark and are highlighted in its documentation.

# Illustrated Features

As a software engineer, I want to watermark source code files with unique, developer-specific identifiers, so I can trace leaks back to the individual who shared them.

As a project manager, I want to securely distribute encrypted source code packages with restricted access links, ensuring only authorized developers can view them.

As a security administrator, I want to integrate SecureCodeMark with version control systems like Git, so I can automatically apply watermarking and encryption to code commits before they are pushed.

# Other Features

As a system administrator, I want to generate invisible yet trackable code markers that do not interfere with functionality, ensuring tamper-proof tracking of shared code.

As a software engineer, I want an automated process to encrypt, host, and distribute watermarked code archives using cloud storage solutions, providing a seamless and secure workflow.

As a developer, I want SecureCodeMark to be easily installable via package managers like pip or npm, ensuring quick adoption by teams.

As a user, I want comprehensive documentation with examples on how to watermark, encrypt, and distribute source code securely, ensuring I can use the tool effectively.

# Potential Feature Expansions

As a security administrator, I want to integrate SecureCodeMark with continuous integration (CI) pipelines, ensuring that all code releases are automatically watermarked and encrypted.

As a project manager, I want to track when and where code archives are accessed, providing insights into distribution and potential unauthorized usage.

As a developer, I want SecureCodeMark to support watermarking and encrypting other types of intellectual property, such as design documents and technical specifications, expanding its use beyond source code.

As a security administrator, I want IP tracking for source code access, adding an additional layer of security and accountability.

As a project manager, I want to set expiration dates for encrypted source code archives, ensuring time-limited access to sensitive projects.

As a security engineer, I want the ability to revoke access to distributed source code, allowing me to immediately restrict access if necessary.

As a developer, I want to customize encryption strength and watermark details, ensuring adaptable security levels based on the project's sensitivity.

As a system administrator, I want SecureCodeMark to be deployable on private enterprise servers or cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, offering flexibility in hosting options.

As a developer, I want to contribute plugins or extensions to SecureCodeMark, enhancing its functionality and adaptability to different workflows.

As a legal compliance officer, I want to generate audit reports of source code access and modifications, ensuring traceability and compliance with company policies.

SecureCodeMark is built to ensure that proprietary source code remains secure and trackable, mitigating the risks of unauthorized sharing while integrating seamlessly with developer workflows.
